## **Phase 1: Spatial dynamics and drivers of land-cover change**

The first phase of this research is the analysis of the spatial dynamic and drivers of land-cover change.

### <a name="data"></a>Data sources 
* Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS imagery from [USGS](http://landsat.usgs.gov/index.php).
* [WRS-2 descending grid](http://landsat.usgs.gov/tools_wrs-2_shapefile.php). 

### <a name="methods"></a>Methods 

#### *Image selection*
* Landsat imagery was selected for 12 tiles for the time period between 2000 and 2016 for a total of 204 Landsat scenes. One Landsat image was selected for each tile for each year. Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 imagery was selected for years 2000 to 2011. Landsat 8 images were used for years 2013 to 2016.
* Landsat scenes with low or none cloud cover over the [study area](index.html#studyarea) were preferred. Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 SLC-on scenes were preferred over Landsat 7 SLC-off scenes. Images taken during the dry season (January-March) were preferred over images taken in other months over the year.
* Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 imagery was selected using the [USGS EarthExplorer](http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). Landsat 8 imagery was selected using the [Libra browser](https://libra.developmentseed.org/).
* The complete list of the selected Landsat imagery can be seen <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HMtOeW7eo_KRrg6BND2eItIp7VS1p0e_YWS3_YHaYEM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. This list also shows progress in image processing and offers links to each scene thumbnail.

#### *Image preparation*
* Images were preprocessed using the [CLASlite](http://claslite.carnegiescience.edu/en/) software.

### <a name="results"></a>Results 
* Landsat imagery was selected for 12 tiles for the time period between 2000 and 2016. One Landsat image was selected for each tile for each year.
